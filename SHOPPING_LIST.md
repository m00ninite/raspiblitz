| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| PC | [Raspberry Pi 4 8GB](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/) | 4GB should also be fine. 8GB if you want to run a lot of services. 
| Power | [CanaKit Power Supply - USB-C 3.5A](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYQRXTK)                                       | None |
| SD Card Storage | [Samsung PRO Endurance 128GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B984HJ5)| Other storage sizes may be fine. Higher capcacity may mean longer life span thanks to wear-leveling.
| SSD Storage | [WD 1TB M.2 SSD](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-NAND-1TB-SSD-WDS100T2B0B/dp/B073SB2MXT)         | None |
| SSD Mounting/Case | [Argon ONE M.2 Aluminum Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MJ3CSW7)         | Includes a fan, but mine runs great with it unplugged. Fully passively cooled thanks to the aluminum case. (30Â°C ambient, 58Â°C actual)
| Display | NOT REQUIRED: Use the [cheapest display](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Portable+HDMI+Monitor+7+Inch) you can find | No permanent display. This is a fully headless system, but a small HDMI monitor can be used for occasional debugging.
| Reliability | [ðŸŒ›m00niniteðŸŒ› Amboss Link](https://amboss.space/node/02c3ffc714b9ea194ec3f4fb46fa08bb0da1430584a60fb2177877fc7434af9b14)   | Online since October 2021 with no crashes.
