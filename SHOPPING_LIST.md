| PC                      | [Raspberry Pi 4 8GB](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/) | 4GB should also be fine. 8GB if you want to run a lot of services. 
| Power        | [CanaKit Power Supply - USB-C 3.5A](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYQRXTK)                                       | None |
| SD Card Storage | [Samsung PRO Endurance 128GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B984HJ5)| Other storage sizes may be fine. Higher capcacity may mean longer life span thanks to wear-leveling.

| Display | N/A | No permanent display, but a small HDMI monitor for occasional debugging 
| Reliability | [ðŸŒ›m00niniteðŸŒ› Amboss Link](https://amboss.space/node/02c3ffc714b9ea194ec3f4fb46fa08bb0da1430584a60fb2177877fc7434af9b14)   | Online since October 2021 with no crashes.
